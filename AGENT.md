# xbot

> Go AI Agent framework with message bus + plugin architecture. Supports Feishu/QQ/CLI/Web channels, tool calling, pluggable memory, skills, subagents, MCP integration.

## Quick Reference

- Entry points: `cmd/xbot-cli/` (CLI), `cmd/runner/` (remote sandbox)
- Build: `go build ./...` | Test: `go test ./...` | Lint: `golangci-lint run ./...`
- Config: `~/.xbot/config.json`, env var overrides
- Pre-commit: gofmt → golangci-lint → go build → go test

## Gotchas — MUST READ Before Any Code Change

### Concurrency
- **Never `defer` semaphore release inside a loop.** Deadlock when iterations exceed capacity. Release immediately after Generate completes.
- Non-blocking channel sends: always use `select` with `ctx.Done()` to prevent blocking on full channels during shutdown.

### Subscription & Model Resolution
- **CLI subscriptions are in config.json, server subscriptions are in DB (`user_llm_subscriptions`).** `GetLLMForModel` must check both — `configSubsFn` (CLI) and `subscriptionSvc` (DB).
- **`UpdateCachedModels(subID)` nil-derefs if subID not in DB.** Always nil-check `sub` after `Get()`. Config subs have IDs not in DB.
- **`OnModelsLoaded` callback runs in `NewOpenAILLM`'s async goroutine** — must be concurrency-safe.
- **Tier fallback**: unconfigured tier → vanguard→balance→swift chain. Empty tier must NOT return default client with wrong model.
- **`createClientFromSub` uses sub's credentials with a *different* model** — verify target model is served by that endpoint.

### Startup
- `NewOpenAILLM` loads model list asynchronously. `ListModels()` returns fallback immediately.
- Settings save is synchronous — all local I/O, no network calls.

### Windows
- `syscall.PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` and `STILL_ACTIVE` not in Go stdlib — define as uint32 constants.
- `exec.ExitError.ExitCode()` is cross-platform; avoid `syscall.WaitStatus` type assertion.
- `signal.Notify(sigCh, syscall.SIGTSTP)` doesn't compile on Windows — use build-tagged files.
- PowerShell env output is newline-delimited, not null-delimited.
